# Introduction

**PReviewer** is a desktop application designed to review github pull requests. The key feature is the ability to view differences in external diff tools such as [Beyond Compare](http://www.scootersoftware.com), [KDiff](http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/), [WinMerge](http://winmerge.org) or whatever you like.

# Features

In this release **PReviewer** provides the ability  to

 * Display the title and description of the pull request.
 * List changed files in a pull request.
 * open the changed files in external difftool, for example beyond compare.
 * Show the differences inside the application itself.
 * Comment on individual files, and submit a general comment. However inline comment on specific commit hasn't been supported yet.
 * Compare commits in the pull request.
